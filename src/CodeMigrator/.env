# This should match the `serverSideRenderingEngineApplicationUrl`

# Be sure to update these values accordingly as your public endpoint changes.

# To secure the Sitecore editor endpoint exposed by your Next.js app

# We recommend an alphanumeric value of at least 16 characters.

# Sitecore JSS npm packages utilize the debug module for debug logging.
# https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug
# Set the DEBUG environment variable to 'sitecore-jss:*' to see all logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:*
# Or be selective and show for example only layout service logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:layout
# Or everything BUT layout service logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:*,-sitecore-jss:layout
